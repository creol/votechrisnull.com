IMAGE UPDATE GUIDE
==================

Your website is now set up with easy-to-update images!

IMAGES YOU NEED:
----------------
1. SLCo5_Logo.png - Your campaign logo (✓ Already added!)
2. hero.jpg - Main photo for the hero section (shows on homepage)
3. about.jpg - Photo for the About section

HOW TO UPDATE IMAGES:
---------------------
1. Name your image files exactly as shown above
2. Place them in the same folder as index.html
3. That's it! The website will automatically use them

IMAGE TIPS:
-----------
• Hero image: Use a high-quality portrait photo (recommended: 800x1000 pixels)
• About image: Professional headshot or candid photo (recommended: 600x800 pixels)
• Logo: Already set up with your SLCo5_Logo.png

TO CHANGE AN IMAGE LATER:
-------------------------
Just replace the file with a new one using the same name!

Example: To update your hero photo, just replace "hero.jpg" with your new photo
(make sure the new photo is also named "hero.jpg")

NEED HELP?
