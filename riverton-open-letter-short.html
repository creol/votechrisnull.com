        <h1>An Open Letter to the Citizens of Riverton, Utah</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">In Support of Our City's Partnership with ICE</p>

        <p class="salutation">Dear Fellow Citizens of Riverton,</p>

        <p>We write today to express our gratitude to the leaders—past and present—who have made Riverton a model for public safety in Utah.</p>

        <p>In August 2025, former Mayor Trent Staggs and Police Chief Shane Taylor demonstrated true foresight when they made Riverton the first city in Utah to sign a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We are equally grateful to Mayor Tish Buroker and our newly elected City Council for their continued support of this partnership. This continuity demonstrates that Riverton's commitment to the rule of law transcends any single administration.</p>

        <p>Our nation was founded on the principle that laws, fairly and consistently applied, protect the rights and safety of all people. When laws are enforced inconsistently or when the rules are unclear, the result is not freedom but fear. Riverton chose clarity and consistency—and our community is safer for it.</p>

        <p>When local leaders work alongside local police and federal agencies, operations run more smoothly and safely. This partnership allows our police department to work directly with federal partners, creating a "force multiplier" for public safety. Interference with law enforcement operations, by contrast, creates serious dangers for officers, subjects, and bystanders alike.</p>

        <p>We hope other cities throughout Salt Lake County will follow Riverton's example. Together, we can make our region a safer and better place to live for all law-abiding residents.</p>
